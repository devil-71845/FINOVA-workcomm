# 1. cat: not the pet, but the command!
The challenge prompted me to invoke cat command on the bash script, 
The command `cat` was introduced.

## My Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QbtI0-huXkbm6jWm3mL0fQKk3Z2.QXxcTN0wiM2gjNzEzW}`

In the problem statement, it was provided that, Finally, if you give no arguments at all, cat will read from the terminal input and output it. We'll explore that in later challenges...

In this challenge, I will copy the flag to the flag file in your home directory (where your shell starts). Go read it with cat!
```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag

# 2. catting absolute paths
The challenge prompted me to invoke cat command on the script in /flag file, 
The command `cat` was introduced.

## My Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0sHWRKHrs3-czg3MhDejekAhZ4s.QX5ETO0wiM2gjNzEzW}`

In the problem statement, it was provided that, Finally, if you give no arguments at all, cat will read from the terminal input and output it. We'll explore that in later challenges...

In this challenge, I will copy the flag to the flag file in your home directory (where your shell starts). Go read it with cat!

In this directory, I will not copy it to your home directory, but I will make it readable. You can read it with cat at its absolute path: /flag.

/flag is where the flag always lives in pwn.college, but unlike in this challenge, you typically can't access that file directly.
```

# 3. more catting practice
The challenge prompted me to invoke cat command on the script in /lib/systemd/system/flag file, 
The command `cat` was introduced.

## My Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YldPCA4gWAi-uJqyliqs1fGDMgT.QXwITO0wiM2gjNzEzW}`

In the problem statement,You can specify all sorts of paths as arguments to commands, and we'll practice some more with cat. In this level, I'll put the flag in some crazy directory, and I will not allow you to change directories with cd, so no cat flag for you. You must retrieve the flag by absolute path, wherever it is.

we have to retrieve the flag file from /lib/systemd/system/flag without using cd. 

/flag is where the flag always lives in pwn.college, but unlike in this challenge, you typically can't access that file directly.

Interestingly, ls doesn't list all the files by default. Linux has a convention where files that start with a . don't show up by default in ls and in a few other contexts. To view them with ls, you need to invoke ls with the -a flag.

Now, it's your turn! Go find the flag, hidden as a dot-prepended file in /.

```  
2. Then ignoring the files where it showed `Permission denied`, I tried using cat on all the files one by one. The first location turned out to be a `directory`. But the second file turned out to be the actual `flag` file.  
```  
hacker@commands~finding-files:~$ cat /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pwnlib/flag
cat: /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pwnlib/flag: Is a directory
hacker@commands~finding-files:~$ cat /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/sympy/core/tests/flag
pwn.college{0-oToRIHhvgtGaoNp0mwRoo0cpX.QXyMDO0wiM2gjNzEzW}hacker@commands~finding-files:~$

```  
  
## What I Learned  
I learnt the usage of `find` command and its syntax.  
  
## References  
The problem statement was the reference used.  
`Now it's your turn. I've hidden the flag in a random directory on the filesystem. It's still called flag. Go find it! Several notes. First, there are other files named flag on the filesystem. Don't panic if the first one you try doesn't have the actual flag in it. Second, there're plenty of places in the filesystem that are not accessible to a normal user. These will cause find to generate errors, but you can ignore those; we won't hide the flag there! Finally, find can take a while; be patient!`

# 14. linking files  
The challenge prompted to link two files, to read out the flag by executing the `catflag` binary.  
## My Solve  
**Flag:** `pwn.college{40P8fxUo_ZE_JNewRRSYTec4vJB.QX5ETN1wiM2gjNzEzW}`  
  
I created a link from the file `/flag` to `~/not-the-flag` as the `/challenge/catflag` reads the file `not-the-flag`, through this I tricked the binary to read me the actual flag at `/flag`.  
```  
hacker@commands~linking-files:~$ ln -s /flag ~/not-the-flag
hacker@commands~linking-files:~$ /challenge/catflag
About to read out the /home/hacker/not-the-flag file!
pwn.college{40P8fxUo_ZE_JNewRRSYTec4vJB.QX5ETN1wiM2gjNzEzW}
hacker@commands~linking-files:~$
  
```  
  
## What I Learned  
I learnt the meaning and usage of links, how a hard and a symbolic link is defined and what is the difference between the both.  
The syntax of creating a symbolic link is `ln -s original_file_fath link_path` .  
  
## References  
The problem statement was the reference used.  
```  
A symlink can be identified as such with a few methods. For example, the file command, which takes a filename and tells you what type of file it is, will recognize symlinks:  
  
hacker@dojo:~$ file /tmp/myfile  
/tmp/myfile: ASCII text  
hacker@dojo:~$ file ~/ourfile  
/home/hacker/ourfile: symbolic link to /tmp/myfile  
hacker@dojo:~$  
  
Okay, now you try it! In this level the flag is, as always, in /flag, but /challenge/catflag will instead read out /home/hacker/not-the-flag. Use the symlink, and fool it into giving you the flag!  
```
